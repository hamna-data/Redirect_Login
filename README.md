# Redirect_Login
This is an Odoo 18 module in which the username, password, and redirect URL are defined in the configuration settings.

The system checks whether the entered credentials match the ones defined in the configuration.

If they match, the user is redirected to the configured redirect URL.

If they do not match, the normal Odoo login process continues.
